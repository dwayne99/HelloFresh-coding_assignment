# HelloFresh-coding_assignment

In this project, I've created a python script that reads two CSV files (Orders, Temperature_bands), calculates the number of ice packs associated with each order based on the temperature and ice pack size and finally exports the new CSV.


```main.py```: Python script to create the new CSV with required ice packs for each order.

```Test.ipynb```: Testing code on python notebook and some basic analysis

```data```: folder with the datasets


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install python packages.

```bash
pip install meteostat
pip install pandas
pip install jupyterlab (optional)
pip install matplotlib (optional)
```


## Usage

```
python main.py 
```
Note: On running the above command you would be prompted to enter the relative path of the temperature_bands dataset (Enter without quotes)
